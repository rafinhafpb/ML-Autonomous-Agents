    "\n",
    "Intelligent decision making involves several components. Today we study, in the context of a toy (low-dimensional, synthetic) example: *perception* (observation), *knowledge* (representation), *reasoning* (inference), and *acting* (decision-making). We will _not_ look at (today): learning and sequential decision making. Using probabalistic tools covered in the lecture (Bayesian networks, marginalization, ...), the objective is to design a rational/intelligent agent, i.e., an agent that maximizes its expected reward. \n",

    "Consider an intelligent agent as a robot tasked with catching rats in a storage room. It is night time, and the room is dark. You have to rely on auditory information only, but luckily the room is a mess with paper and other debris that means there are distinct sounds which are emitted by a rat as it touches different objects (namely, crinkling and rustling sounds). The room is rectangular, divided up into $n$ square tiles.  A rat has just entered the room (current time $t=1$). The agent waits $T$ seconds (i.e., until $t=T$), then makes a decision on if and where to pounce (in order to catch the rat)."

    "Let $s_t \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ denote the position (state) of the rat at time step $t$ (one of $n$ grid tiles); starting at some $s_1$ (entry tile). And $\\mathbf{x}_t \\in \\{0,1\\}^2$ is the 2-dimensional auditory observation at time $t$ (e.g., $\\mathbf{x}_t = [1,0]$ if there is a crinkle but no rustle, etc). The agent accumulates a sequence of **observations** $\\mathbf{x}_{1:T} = \\mathbf{x}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_T$, with which to make the decision of taking **action** $a$ to pounce (denoting the tile upon which it pounces). The agent obtains **reward** $r(s,a) = 1_{s = a}$, i.e., catching the rat provides reward $1$ and $0$ otherwise. \n",

There are two limitations here: the toy nature of the environment (maybe your solution does not scale up to large $d$ or large $T$) and the requirement for a hand-coded environment. Next week we will look at efficient inference, and learning (including, representation learning) which allows to overcome these limitations; toward not only an autonomous agent, but a capable and scalable autonomous agent.
